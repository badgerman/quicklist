## deprecation warning

This repository is deprecated! I am moving all my single-file libraries to a shared repository at https://github.com/ennorehling/clibs where this implementation lives on in selist.h

## quicklist

A simple list that is better than (value, next) tuples in performance
and memory usage.

The tests in this repository depends on the [cutest](https://github.com/ennorehling/cutest) module.
You may have to update the Makefile to point it to your local checkout.
